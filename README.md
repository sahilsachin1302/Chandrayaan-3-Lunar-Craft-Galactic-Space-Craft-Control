# Chandrayaan-3-Lunar-Craft-Galactic-Space-Craft-Control
The GalacticSpaceCraft is a Python class that simulates the movement of a spacecraft in a 3D space. It provides methods for moving the spacecraft, changing its direction, and executing a sequence of commands.

Run the main script to interact with the GalacticSpaceCraft:
"python main.py"

The project also includes a set of unit tests in the test_galactic_spacecraft.py file. To run the tests, use the following command:
"python -m unittest test_galactic_spacecraft.py"

By following TDD principles and writing tests for each piece of functionality,I ensure that the GalacticSpaceCraft class behaves as expected and any future changes are less likely to introduce bugs.
